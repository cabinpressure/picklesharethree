Work In Process, this will be a python 3 only version of PickleShare with Blosc compression built in...

This is more for my education than for any real usage.

We'll see how far I get on it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

From the original:

PickleShare - a small 'shelve' like datastore with concurrency support

Like shelve, a PickleShareDB object acts like a normal dictionary. Unlike shelve,
many processes can access the database simultaneously. Changing a value in
database is immediately visible to other processes accessing the same database.

Concurrency is possible because the values are stored in separate files. Hence
the "database" is a directory where *all* files are governed by PickleShare.
